## 30-Minute Challenge

* Navigate your browser so that you can see the list of products.
* Try clicking on an item's photo or title, to go to the product's details page.
* Try editing an item's information.
* Try deleting an item.

HINT: You can `rake db:seed` whenever you want to perform a "factory reset" on the product catalog again.

Be ready to answer the following questions:

1. What does `rake db:seed` do?
1. What HTML enables you to click a product's photo to go to that product's page?
1. How does the clicking the Delete button work?  Can you follow the entire RCAV cycle to explain it?
1. How does the "Add a New Product" button work?  Can you follow the entire RCAV cycle to explain it?
1. How does the Edit link work, and what happens when you modify some data and submit the form?
